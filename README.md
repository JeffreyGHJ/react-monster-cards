# React Monster Cards

Battle against monsters as cards!

Try the demo! -> [https://react-monster-cards.vercel.app/](https://react-monster-cards.vercel.app/)

## Description

This is a game demo that I created while learning how to build React web applications. 

In this game demo, users can battle against a small variety of monsters which are depicted on playing card style components. 

The project also includes authentication and persistence with a Firebase database so that users can save their game progress between application sessions. There is also a leaderboard which ranks all players saved in the database by thier player level.

This project was initially bootstrapped with React create-react-app but was later migrated to Next.js next-app in order to leverage the use of Next.js API routes and file based routing. Additionally, Redux Toolkit is used for this app's reactive state management choice.

## How to Run
